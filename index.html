<a id="getting-into-the-city" class="anchor" href="#getting-into-the-city" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting into the city</h3>

<p>Seattle has a pretty quick light rail to shuttle people to and from the airport.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's cheap: $3.00 </li>
<li>Not too slow: ~40min to Westlake Center</li>
</ul>

<p>To take it, you want to exit the airport, toward the parking garage. If you don't check a bag, pass the ticketing booths and take an escalator down to a skybridge, which takes you into the parking garage. If you check a bag, you need to first take an escalator down to baggage claim, and then take an escalator to the skybridge. Once in the parking garage, take a left and walk all the way to the train terminal.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Maps-and-Directions/PublishingImages/literail.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Once at the terminal, buy a ticket with the machine, going to Downtown Seattle or Westlake. (I forget what you tell it.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Parking-and-Transportation/Ground-Transportation/Pages/Public-Transit.aspx">SeaTac Light Rail</a> page has all the info you need, including a video of how to get to the light rail (which is ridiculous, because it is easy).</p>

<p>The Light Rail will drop you off in the Bus Tunnel, under Westlake Center- make your way topside. (Hey, you found the Macy's! And the World's First Nordstroms!) From there it's 3 blocks to the hotel. Safe to walk.</p>



<h2>
<a id="things-to-do" class="anchor" href="#things-to-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Things to do!</h2>

<p>I've brainstormed some activities that are in similar locations throughout the city: use it as a guide if you want, nothing is day dependent.<br>
The weather will be pretty nice for the entire time you're there.</p>

<h3>
<a id="pike-place-market--waterfront" class="anchor" href="#pike-place-market--waterfront" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pike Place Market // Waterfront</h3>

<p>Pike Place Market is an institution and I'm sure you've been here before. Regardless, here's some ideas of what to do if you give it another look. </p>

<p>Additionally, it's really easy to pop down to the waterfront. There's some major construction going on down there, but a lot of attractions will still be open.</p>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fish throwing</strong>

<ul>
<li>Just wandering through the market is fun: this is a good place to start. See some flying salmon, browse all the stalls for art, flowers and fresh produce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Gum Wall</strong>

<ul>
<li>It's a wall of gum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The First Starbucks!</strong></li>
<li>
<a href="http://zigzagseattle.com/">Zig Zag</a> and <a href="http://pikebrewing.com/">Pike Brewing</a>

<ul>
<li>Zig Zag is one of the best cocktail bars on the West Coast, if not the country, and surprisingly non-pretentious. It's tucked away on the Pike Place stairclimb. Pike Brewing is a nice local microbrewery with a pretty big food menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Eat some fresh seafood!</strong> <a href="http://www.athenianinn.com/">The Athenian</a> or <strong>Pike Place Chowder</strong> are good places for local seafood, since Ivars and Elliots on the waterfront will be closed (might want to check on that). </li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.seattleaquarium.org/">Seattle Aquarium</a> is super close to Pike Place market on the other side of the viaduct. Go see the sea otters and the Giant Pacific Octopus!</li>
<li>I've never been on the <a href="http://seattlegreatwheel.com/">Great Wheel</a>, but it looks like fun! Should give great views of the Sound.</li>
<li>
<strong>Get on a boat!</strong>

<ul>
<li>If you want to get out on the water and see Seattle from a distance, there's a bunch of options. The <a href="http://www.wsdot.com/ferries/schedule/ScheduleDetailByRoute.aspx?route=sea-bi">Bainbridge Island Ferry</a> is $8.00 round trip and will give you a great view of the city. It's a 35 min trip and drops you off at Bainbridge Island (kinda fun to explore the harbor area).</li>
<li>For a tour option, check out <a href="http://www.argosycruises.com/">Argosy Cruises</a>. They have some more comprehensive options.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/WaterTaxi/WSeattle.aspx">West Seattle Ferry</a> is pretty cool. This is a small commuter ferry that takes people from West Seattle to Downtown Seattle. Once in West Seattle, you can take a nice stroll north along the beach and grab some lunch at the restaurants by the water.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3>
<a id="westlake--seattle-center" class="anchor" href="#westlake--seattle-center" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Westlake // Seattle Center</h3>

<p>You can connect the sights at the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP) to Westlake and downtown with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjTv_bJRwf4">Monorail</a>! None of these things are too far away from Pike Place Market, so you can mix and match.</p>

<h4>
<a id="downtown" class="anchor" href="#downtown" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Downtown</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Central Library</strong> 

<ul>
<li>The main branch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Central_Library">Seattle Public Library</a> is really cool. Best one you'll ever visit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>First Nordstrom's</strong> is in Westlake Center. 

<ul>
<li>Go buy something in honor of Seattle's Scandanavian heritage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some <strong>food</strong> places downtown/near your hotel:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.kukuruza.com/pages/seattle-popcorn">KukuRuZa Gourment Popcorn</a>: I know you like popcorn- this is supposed to be good</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.mamas.com">Mama's Mexican Burritos</a> has great burritos.</li>
<li>Shorty's is more of a dive bar, but has hotdogs and pinball!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="seattle-center" class="anchor" href="#seattle-center" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Seattle Center</h4>

<p>To get from Westlake to Seattle Center, you can take the <a href="http://www.seattlemonorail.com/">monorail!</a>. The stop is at the top of Westlake Center, inside. Costs $2.25 one way and you can pretend like you're in 1962.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Space Needle</strong>

<ul>
<li>You can still pretend it's 1962.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>EMP</strong>

<ul>
<li>This is a super cool music museum (plus scifi stuff I guess). A little expensive, but really interesting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Chihuly Garden and Glass</strong>

<ul>
<li>Features work from world-famous glass artist Dale Chihuly, who is local to the area. Super cool, I think you two will really enjoy it. Also is the scene from that one movie where Kiera Knightley doesn't want to be a grownup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Pacific Science Center</strong>

<ul>
<li>Used to go <a href="http://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/">here</a> a lot as a kid. A lot of kid-oriented things, but it's still pretty neat, and they have some cool IMAX movies playing, laser shows, a planetarium and a butterfly house! Maybe you'll see local Bill Nye!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Seattle Center, there's a nice food court called the Armory if you're hungry. Also there's a Dick's near Seattle Center which is a Seattle institution.</li>
</ul>



<h3>
<a id="university-district" class="anchor" href="#university-district" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>University District</h3>

<p>The main reason I'm including this is because Maggie wants to go kayaking and the weather is going to be really awesome. There are two really easy places to rent kayaks/canoes in the area and some fun places to explore. I've included some other things to do if you head that way.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Kayaking in Lake Union</strong>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://aguaverde.com/">Agua Verde</a> is a restauarant/cafe that also rents kayaks on Lake Union! You can grab some lunch and then paddle around. Check out their website for info, I think kayaks aren't reserved, you just go day-of and grab them.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.washington.edu/ima/wac/">University of Washington WAC</a> also has canoes and kayaks to rent, and I think their rates are a little cheaper. Don't have to be a Husky to rent them. To get there, you walk through the parking lot by Husky Stadium.</li>
<li>Either option is great. Explore Lake Union or go over to the Arboreteum, try to spot a bald eagle or two.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gas Works Park</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>While exploring Lake Union, you might see a park with some old o</li>
