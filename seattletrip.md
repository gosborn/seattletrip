###Getting into the city

Seattle has a pretty quick light rail to shuttle people to and from the airport.

* It's cheap: $3.00 
* Not too slow: ~40min to Westlake Center

To take it, you want to exit the airport, toward the parking garage. If you don't check a bag, you pass the ticketing booths and take an escalator down to a skybridge, which takes you into the parking garage. If you check a bag, you need to first take an escalator down to baggage claim, and then take an escalator to the skybridge. Once in the parking garage, take a left and walk all the way to the train terminal.

Once at the terminal, buy a ticket with the machine, going to Downtown Seattle or Westlake. (I forget what you tell it.)

The [SeaTac Light Rail](http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Parking-and-Transportation/Ground-Transportation/Pages/Public-Transit.aspx) page has all the info you need, including a video of how to get to the light rail (which is ridiculous, because it is easy).

The Light Rail will drop you off in the Bus Tunnel, under Westlake. Make your way topside to Westlake Center. (Hey, you found the Macy's! And the World's First Nordstroms!) From there it's 3 blocks to the hotel. Safe to walk.
