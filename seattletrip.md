###Getting into the city

Seattle has a pretty quick light rail to shuttle people to and from the airport.

* It's cheap: $3.00 
* Not too slow: ~40min to Westlake Center

To take it, you want to exit the airport, toward the parking garage. If you don't check a bag, pass the ticketing booths and take an escalator down to a skybridge, which takes you into the parking garage. If you check a bag, you need to first take an escalator down to baggage claim, and then take an escalator to the skybridge. Once in the parking garage, take a left and walk all the way to the train terminal.

Once at the terminal, buy a ticket with the machine, going to Downtown Seattle or Westlake. (I forget what you tell it.)

The [SeaTac Light Rail](http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Parking-and-Transportation/Ground-Transportation/Pages/Public-Transit.aspx) page has all the info you need, including a video of how to get to the light rail (which is ridiculous, because it is easy).

The Light Rail will drop you off in the Bus Tunnel, under Westlake Center- make your way topside. (Hey, you found the Macy's! And the World's First Nordstroms!) From there it's 3 blocks to the hotel. Safe to walk.

##Things to do!

I've brainstormed some activities that are in similar locations throughout the city: use it as a guide if you want, nothing is day dependent.   
The weather will be pretty nice for the entire time you're there.


###Pike Place Market // Waterfront

Pike Place Market is an institution and I'm sure you've been here before. Regardless, here's some ideas of what to do if you give it another look. 

Additionally, it's really easy to pop down to the waterfront. There's some major construction going on down there, but a lot of attractions will still be open.

- **Fish throwing**
	- Just wandering through the market is fun: this is a good place to start. See some flying salmon, browse all the stalls for art, flowers and fresh produce.
- **Gum Wall**
	- It's a wall of gum.
- **The First Starbucks!**
- [Zig Zag](http://zigzagseattle.com/) and [Pike Brewing](http://pikebrewing.com/)
	- Zig Zag is one of the best cocktail bars on the West Coast, if not the country, and surprisingly non-pretentious. It's tucked away on the Pike Place stairclimb. Pike Brewing is a nice local microbrewery with a pretty big food menu.
- **Pike Place Chowder** is a good place for some local seafood options, since Ivars and Elliots on the waterfront will be closed (might want to check on that).
- The [Seattle Aquarium](http://www.seattleaquarium.org/) is super close to Pike Place market on the other side of the viaduct. Go see the sea otters and the Giant Pacific Octopus!
- I've never been on the [Great Wheel](http://seattlegreatwheel.com/), but it looks like fun! Should give great views of the Sound.
- **Get on a boat!**
	- If you want to get out on the water and see Seattle from a distance, there's a bunch of options. The [Bainbridge Island Ferry](http://www.wsdot.com/ferries/schedule/ScheduleDetailByRoute.aspx?route=sea-bi) is $8.00 round trip and will give you a great view of the city. It's a 35 min trip and drops you off at Bainbridge Island (kinda fun to explore the harbor area).
	- For a tour option, check out [Argosy Cruises](http://www.argosycruises.com/). They have some more comprehensive options.
	- The [West Seattle Ferry](http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/WaterTaxi/WSeattle.aspx) is pretty cool. This is a small commuter ferry that takes people from West Seattle to Downtown Seattle. Once in West Seattle, you can take a nice stroll north along the beach and grab some lunch at the restaurants by the water.
