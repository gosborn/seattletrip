If you don't check a bag, you pass the ticketing booths and take an escalator down to a skybridge, which takes you into the parking garage. If you check a bag, you need to first take an escalator down to baggage claim, and then take an escalator to the skybridge. Once in the parking garage, take a left and walk all the way to the train terminal.\r\n\r\n![](http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Maps-and-Directions/PublishingImages/literail.gif)\r\n\r\nOnce at the terminal, buy a ticket with the machine, going to Downtown Seattle or Westlake. (I forget what you tell it.)\r\n\r\nThe [SeaTac Light Rail](http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Parking-and-Transportation/Ground-Transportation/Pages/Public-Transit.aspx) page has all the info you need, including a video of how to get to the light rail (which is ridiculous, because it is easy).\r\n\r\nThe Light Rail will drop you off in the Bus Tunnel, under Westlake. Make your way topside to Westlake Center. (Hey, you found the Macy's! And the World's First Nordstroms!) From there it's 3 blocks to the hotel. Safe to walk.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0\" src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/directions?origin=Westlake%20Center%2C%20Pine%20Street%2C%20Seattle%2C%20WA%2C%20United%20States&destination=Warwick%20Seattle%20Hotel%2C%20Lenora%20Street%2C%20Seattle%2C%20WA%2C%20United%20States&key=AIzaSyB1iXz25tZqJe3f-9jswQNq3Qr19ZPW5Ts\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n##friday\r\n\r\n###things to do, BRAINSTORM  \r\n\r\n* xseattle public library  \r\n* xspace needle/seattle center  \r\n* xmonorail  \r\n* emp  \r\n* shops at og nordstroms  \r\n\r\n\r\n* xpike place market\r\n\t- flying fish\r\n\t- gum wall\r\n\t- pike brewery\r\n\t- first starbucks\r\n\t- zig zag\r\n\r\n\r\n* waterfront\r\n\t- go on big ferris wheel\r\n\tx- go to aquarium\r\n\t\t- see sea otters do sea otter things\r\n\t\t- say hi to octopus\r\n\tx- go on boat tour?\r\n\t- go on ferry?\r\n\t\t- in bainbridge island:\r\n\t\t\t- find some restaurant\r\n\tx- eat at ivar's\r\n\t- olympic scuplture garden\r\n\tx- take water taxi to west seattle\r\n\t\t- go to beach\r\n\r\n\r\n* xkayaking in lake union?\r\n\t- stalking house hunter man\r\n\tx- gas works park\r\n\tx- see university of washington\r\n\t\t- suzzallo library\r\n\t\t- walk up and down university way (the ave)\r\n\t\t- go to college inn\r\n\t- fremont troll?\r\n\r\n* ballard? \r\n\tx- locks\r\n\tx- cute old downtown\r\n\tx- kiss cafe?\r\n\t\t- drink greg's glass\r\n\t\t- do not drop greg's glass\r\n\t- hang out with boyd\r\n\t- cupcake royale\r\n\t- all those little breweries (with boyd as tour guide???)\r\n\r\n\r\nfriday\r\nmonday\r\ntuesdays\r\n\r\nsaturday?\r\nwedding\r\n<strong>but what does holly do</strong>\r\n\r\nsunday?\r\nbrunch with greg\r\ngo to gerg's house?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbars/restaurants to go to\r\n\r\none of the elysians?\r\nzig zag cafe\r\nDIM SUM\r\nkiss cafe?\r\nivars\r\nanother seafood place?\r\none of the dicks\r\nSOME REAL PHO\r\nstarbucks\r\nand other coffee places in the hoods you go\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
